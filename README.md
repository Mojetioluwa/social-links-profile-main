## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup: I've learned the importance of using semantic elements in HTML. It not only makes the code easier to read and maintain, but also improves accessibility.
- CSS custom properties: I've discovered the power of CSS custom properties, which allowed me to create more flexible and maintainable styles.
- Flexbox: This project helped me to understand and master CSS Flexbox. It's a powerful tool for creating responsive layouts.
- Mobile-first workflow: I've adopted a mobile-first approach in this project. It's a design strategy that starts with designing for smaller screens first and then enhancing the experience for larger screens.


### What I learned

This project was a great learning experience for me. I've learned how to structure my HTML in a semantic way, how to create flexible and maintainable styles with CSS custom properties, and how to create responsive layouts with Flexbox. I've also adopted a mobile-first workflow, which I found to be a very effective design strategy.


### Continued development

I plan to continue improving my CSS skills, especially in areas like Grid and animations.


### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is also useful for practice.
